            We are very excited to announce that the fifth edition of the
            Paredes de Coura Fan Weekend is coming soon, this time for real!
          </p>

          <p>
            Since we cannot get together at Paredes de Coura, we will meet at
            your place. Don't worry, we leave the shoes at the door.
          </p>

          <p>
            As you may have guessed already, this time the event will be online.
            If you've been to one of the previous events, you know what we are
            capable of. However, this online thing is a whole new game with
            great challenges. We are still trying to figure some things out but
            we are commited to make the best online AFOL event.
